- Tests for transpose
- Split assign/pass?
- Traits
  - Common trait to help de-duplicate traits that vary only slightly between each other
  - Warnings for overriding existing procs, to prevent redefining result calls and such

FUTURE

- Ritual/DSL-method for handling contents of enumerables
- Result DSL call improvements
  - No result call made equates to result_class.new
  - No block, but arguments given are args passed directly to result_class.new(*args)
  - Block given accepts source as a block var to initialize manually
  - Block given with args raises an exception?
- Ability to access specific procs in the recipe by sane naming
  - Allow for more fine-grained unit testing
- Lazy loading based on rigid filename pattern
  - Removes omnipresent hash in memory from boot
  - Allows recipes not in use to be GCed
  - Would need config definition for recipes directory
    - Convenience of Railtie defining app/recipes/ automatically
- DSL method for custom rituals?
